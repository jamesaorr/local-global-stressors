This GitHub repository contains the code (as three separate R notebooks) and data used in the paper: "Can local management practices offset the impacts of climate change on freshwater macroinvertebrate communities?" by James A. Orr, Gianbattista Bussi, Jocelyne M.R. Hughes, Paul G. Whitehead and Michelle C. Jackson.

The folder "data" contains raw data (biomonitoring data, shapefiles, water quality data) as well as results (regression outputs, organised datasets, ecological forecats, process-based modelling outputs) from the analyses.
